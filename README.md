### Hello, I'm Galip 👋

I go with the flow.  
Sometimes I dive into Kdenlive, sometimes it's Python, sometimes FreeCAD.  
Mostly on Linux (EndeavourOS / KDE Plasma 6 + Wayland).  
I enjoy creating things — visuals, tools, or just weird little experiments.

🎮 Games I like: Tannenberg, Verdun, Team Fortress 2, 0 A.D.  
🧠 Currently learning: Spanish, Python, Bash  
🛠️ Fiddling with open-source, automating stuff, and staying curious.

No big goals — just exploring and building whatever feels fun.
